# Analysis of Property Prices in England and Wales
This repository contains the data, code, and analysis for investigating the drivers of residential property prices in England and Wales. The project includes data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering, and insights into regional property price dynamics.

# Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- BC - Download Cleaning Merging.Rmd: R Markdown file containing the code for downloading, cleaning, and merging datasets from multiple sources.
- BC - Exploratory Data Analysis.Rmd: R Markdown file for performing exploratory data analysis, including visualizations and correlation analysis of variables.
- BC - Clustering analysis.ipynb: Python notebook implementing clustering analysis using K-means and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to segment properties based on key characteristics.
- final_dataset.zip: Zip file that contains the final cleaned and merged dataset (csv) used for all analyses.
- School_Characteristics.zip: A ZIP file containing School Quality data from the ONS. This dataset was downloaded manually from the web and used to create the final_dataset. It could not be incorporated directly into the R script due to the dynamic naming of the output ZIP files generated by the ONS download system.

# Data Sources
The datasets used in this analysis were sourced from:

- Office for National Statistics (ONS): Median property prices and school characteristics metrics.
- Valuation Office Agency: Council tax bands and housing stock.
- Department of Transport: Travel times to employment centers, schools, and hospitals.

# Key Findings
- Property prices are influenced by council tax bands, accessibility to key amenities, and school characteristics.
- Clustering identified three distinct segments: remote and affordable areas, accessible mid-tier areas, and premium areas.
- PCA effectively reduced dimensionality, enhancing the interpretability of clustering results.
